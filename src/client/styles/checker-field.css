/*  
  Scroll-margin-top styling for checkbox and radio inputs.

  This style cannot be passed directly to CheckboxInput / RadioInput due to how Chakra composes
  custom checkboxes.

  In this case, Chakra uses a hidden native checkbox/radio input in conjunction with a styled
  control element. Styles props passed to CheckboxInput / RadioInput are passed down to
  the control element instead, which would work for 99% of use cases.
  
  However, the ref element returned by CheckboxInput / RadioInput, which we pass to react-hook-form
  for handling scroll-into-view, refers to the hidden native input element instead. As this element
  does not recieve the styles from the style prop passed to CheckboxInput / RadioInput, we thus
  resort to using CSS class style overrides to implement scroll margins instead.
